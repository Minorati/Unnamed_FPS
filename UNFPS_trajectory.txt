end-goals:
	few levels
	"solid"/"satisfying" gameplay
	engaging in movement should be rewarding

general combat range:
	primarily close-mid range
		melee for good damage - maybe feeding a meter
		mid-range guns for reliable damage - maybe with potential for close range application

level design:
	theming:
		various - styling is a later feature
	geometry/architecture:
		somewhat tight levels
		room-to-room for levels
		reminiscent of OG quake

weapon design:
	core weapons:
		TBD - future feature
	melee weapon(s):
		maintain high risk high reward
		implement with stances
		should have generous hitboxes
			very close range can be claustrophic and take away the feeling of control
		can add parrying as a stance move
	guns:
		maintain consistency in baseline strength
		situationally powerful
		mostly independent of stances
	reloading:
		universal cooldown?
		infinite reserve?

mechanics:
	command inputs:
		modifying melee attacks
		not interfere with ranged attacks
		not interfere with movement
		incentivize deliberation in entering a stance
			to prevent mis-movement
			to prevent mis-input
		should reward players with options instead of just damage
		should reward knowledge and observation
	stances:
		can be accessed by command inputs
		can be accessed conditionally - stances, certain attacks
		give left and right strafe more functionality other than "just" movement
			maybe as a cancel?
			maybe as a reload?

air control
	not too much air friction
	give access to air movement potentially via stances
	be able to access grounded state conveniently

enemies:
	enemies should range from weak to overwhelming strength
		strength through taking immense damage should be minimized
		strength should be determined by applications and options:
			projectile spam
			evasiveness
			melee threat
			coerced movement
			forcing stances (and having to understand your stance cancels)
			some knowledge checks (be mindful to maintain simplicity)
	a majority of enemies should be accessible to being "gunned down"
	massively reducing damage vs enemies is not fun
	should have special openings to encourage player to not just run and gun
		through weapon interaction
		through weakspots
		through status effects
