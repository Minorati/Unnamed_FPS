few levels
"solid" gameplay

mid-close range combat
	somewhat tighter levels
	something like OG quake

find ways to incentivize using other weps
	universal cooldown?
	infinite reserve?
	need new weps sometime soon (few)

theming
	various -ish

command inputs that modify melee attacks
	not interfere with ranged attacks
	not interfere with movement

core weapons
	need

melee
	should be "generous"
	very close range is not fun to press punches on
	parry as a stance

air control
	do not have air friction or some

enemies should range from fodder
	to *jacked*
	can be knowledge/experience checks (keep it simple-ish)

maybe having a reason to use left and right strafe other than dodging

weakspots? opening up enemies?
	creating special openings instead of "this weapon does more/less dmg"
